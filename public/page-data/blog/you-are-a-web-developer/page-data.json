It has been a little while since I wrote about anything. I have been meaning to, but just need a little oomph…that little oomph came today in a YouTube comment.</p>\n<h2>The Gist</h2>\n<p>So there seemed to be a small YouTube comment war between myself and a couple other ppl over learning and groking JavaScript and having that as a sufficient skill under your toolbelt. I believe the words were.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>dont you need JS to be a Web developer? I mean thats like programming 101 for a decent Web dev IMO.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>dont you need JS to be a Web developer? I mean thats like programming 101 for a decent Web dev IMO.</p>\n<p>Hmm…what about the debate between what being a developer means, opposed to being a programmer. I never said I was programmer. I would also argue that programming 101 and Web dev 101 are two totally different things. That is like comparing Java to JavaScript.</p>\n<h2>The Truth</h2>\n<p>The fact of the matter is this. You do not have to be a JavaScript expert to be a Web developer. Ask yourself this question, “do I write code that is used on the Web?”. If the answer is yes, than you are a Web developer. My strength lies in the UI, I am not a JavaScript expert. It has taken me a couple years to finally start groking the inner workings of JavaScript, outside of basic concepts and functionality, and still it is my greatest weakness.</p>\n<p>All that aside, I accepted a senior ui developer position for a company here in Metro Detroit and the company knows I have a weakness in the JavaScript universe. Do I know JavaScript? Yes. Am I an expert JavaScript developer? No. Do I write code for the Web? Yes. Well than, I guess that buries the hatchet on that comment.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://medium.com/u/a585b33a793?source=post_page-----986c5a4bdebb----------------------\">Angelina Fabbro</a> summed it up great in her JSConfUS 2013 talk. <a href=\"https://youtu.be/v0TFmdO4ZP0\">Angelina Fabbro at JSConfUS 2013</a></p>","frontmatter":{"date":"October 31, 2016","path":"/blog/you-are-a-web-developer","title":"You’re a Web Developer?"}}},"pageContext":{}}}
