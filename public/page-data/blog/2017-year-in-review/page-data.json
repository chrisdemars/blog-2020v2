It isn’t quite March yet, we still have to finish out January and get through February so I am making progress on my procrastination. Without further ado, my year in review!</p>\n<h1>Good bye 2017, hello 2018!</h1>\n<p>Last year was okay, not the best. Went through some heart break, family surgery, but did manage to make it out of all of that alive and spoke at 5 conferences, which was a huge achievement for me personally and professionally. I didn’t travel much, so lets talk about all the things.</p>\n<h1>Travel</h1>\n<p>I didn’t make it to Denver a whole lot, I think once the whole year and that was in August. Had a great time though, couple professional things to take care of, spent a night in Strawberry Springs and hung out in West Wash Park. I got to speak at a conference in Virginia Beach, that was pretty fresh.</p>\n<p>I hope this year I get a chance to travel more and make it over sees to some destination, whatever it may be.</p>\n<h1>Community</h1>\n<p>I took a big break from community this year. I only went to a handful of meetups but still managed to design and print the stickers for Global Accessibility Awareness Day.</p>\n<p>I was asked to be co-organizer for the <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/a2a11y\">Ann Arbor Accessibility Group</a>, that was definitly a big deal for me. Other than that, I didn’t do much. I hope to change that this year and bring the community together in an impactful way, especially focused around accessibility on the web.</p>\n<h1>Life</h1>\n<p>Not many life changes happened last year. My mom had cancer surgery at the beginning of the year and she is doing well. I call her “half-off” becuase now she only has one kidney. It is rather funny if you knew our relationship.</p>\n<p>I am still working at United Shore but transferred to a new team to focus on responsiveness, performance, and accessibility of a new project and to be a lead in those areas for three more projects as well as implementing PWA’s for our applications. I am stoked to be spearheading that.</p>\n<p>I spoke at 5 conferences lastyear, that’s right, I said 5. The first was CodeMash (2 talks), IgniteUX MI (1 talk), Self.Conf (1 talk), RevConf (2 talks), and Detroit.Code() (2 talks). Last year was a stellar year for conferences for me and a goal I set out to achieve. This year I I have two conferences already lined up and am stoked to fill up the year.</p>\n<h1>Code and Blog Things</h1>\n<p>I didn’t get much done last year in the way of coding and writing. I lost a lot of motivation as the year progressed, I became very depressed again and my back started acting up until I was referred to see a surgeon by my 8th chiropractor, which I am doing now. Surgery is in the future, I am excited for that and getting my life back. A good thing that came out of my writing was that I wrote an article for David Walsh’s Blog all about focus styles and accessibility, <a href=\"https://davidwalsh.name/css-focus\">check it out here</a>!</p>\n<p>Still can’t JavaScript myself out of a paper bag, but you know what, that is okay. There is a vast community of developers out there that can’t, devs who excel in other areas andare valued for those other skills, not just being a JavaScript developer.</p>\n<p>I participated in Hacktoberfest too and I got my shirt and stickers!!</p>\n<p>Started a podcast called Tales From the Script! Check it out on <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/tales-from-the-script/id1269393687?mt=2\">iTunes</a>, <a href=\"https://play.google.com/music/m/Iowf6ktgvha3b2xibz5f65zuma4?t=Tales_From_The_Script\">Google Play</a> and <a href=\"https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/tales-from-the-script\">Stitcher</a>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/2800/1*FuralKUYHne1r_P1cJoPyg.png\"></p>\n<p>This year I will try to write more and work on projects and attempt JS again, knowing after surgery that I can live life again will be a huge help.</p>\n<p>GitHub stats for the year:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/3028/1*2THRUmih2KC-CYA8WegrFw.png\"></p>\n<h1>2018 Goals</h1>\n<p>This year I have a set of goals that isn’t outrageous like last year, but there are some things I want to get done.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Submit to all the conferences that I can.</li>\n<li>Start and finish more projects that I have on the back burner.</li>\n<li>Level up my JS skills big time. I have to find a way for it to click, or not.</li>\n<li>More community involvement.</li>\n<li>Write more blog posts about web development and things that interest me in the industry.</li>\n<li>Write for another magazine or web dev blog.</li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"date":"January 26, 2018","path":"/blog/2017-year-in-review","title":"2017 Year in Review"}}},"pageContext":{}}}
