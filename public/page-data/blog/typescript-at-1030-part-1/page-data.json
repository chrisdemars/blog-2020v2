The developer who works strictly in the UI space, by UI, I mean user interface, NOT interactivity. This didn’t happen on purpose, this was purely accidental (ask me later).</p>\n<p>The first thing that comes to mind when I think of user interactivityis JavaScript. All forms and flavors of JavaScript from Angular to TypeScript. Yes, the smorgasbord of usable and useless libraries and frameworks is overwhelming, but hey, let’s give TypeScript a try shall we?</p>\n<h2>Meh…TypeScript?</h2>\n<p>So TypeScript, superset of JavaScript if I am correct, and very scalable. Sounds cool, so let’s give it a shot. Open up your terminal and start with installing TypeScript.</p>\n<h3>First</h3>\n<p>If you want to write TypeScript locally, first you should install it with npm.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"bash\"><pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\"><span class=\"token function\">npm</span> <span class=\"token function\">install</span> -g typescript</code></pre></div>\n<h3>Second</h3>\n<p>Create a new directory where you want to play around with TS and navigate in to that directory.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"bash\"><pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\"><span class=\"token function\">mkdir</span> typescript-fun <span class=\"token operator\">&amp;&amp;</span> <span class=\"token builtin class-name\">cd</span> typescript-fun</code></pre></div>\n<h3>Third</h3>\n<p>Create a new file with a <code class=\"language-text\">.ts</code> extension.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"bash\"><pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\"><span class=\"token function\">touch</span> app.ts</code></pre></div>\n<h3>Compile</h3>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"bash\"><pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">tsc app.ts</code></pre></div>\n<h2>Type Annotations</h2>\n<p>TypeScript has a thing called “type annotations”. Basically, without the jargon, you can declare the specific type of variable you are instantiating. We have a few different types in JavaScript; number, string, bool, array, object, and believe it or not, a function. Below I demonstrate how to declare types on variables in TypeScript.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/5532/1*cOvtOSyEPyAoVMcUxlxYjg.png\" alt=\"TypeScript REPL\"></p>\n<p>However, if you choose to contradict the strict types you will get errors like below. To be clear, these are errors in TypeScript, BUT they are completely valid in JavaScript…so I have been told.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/5564/1*ur_KSOZbK0E9S_EDHrGJvQ.png\" alt=\"TypeScript REPL\"></p>\n<h2>The Why?</h2>\n<p>Well, I can’t tell you the why. Why do you ask? I am not a JavaScript developer, nor am I a TypeScript developer, but my buddy <a href=\"https://medium.com/u/6a9b994d04dc?source=post_page-----8158529b30e3----------------------\">David Pine</a> summarized the why for me.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>So basically the benefit of TypeScript is that it will help developers write more scalable JS. The static typing allows the IDE to show developers that perhaps they are not following the intent of the code, as there are conflicts with the types.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So basically the benefit of TypeScript is that it will help developers write more scalable JS. The static typing allows the IDE to show developers that perhaps they are not following the intent of the code, as there are conflicts with the types.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Well, that’s it for now. This post served as a basic introduction into what I now know about TypeScript and what I am currently learning. Next up in this series, I will look at something else cool about TypeScript, just not sure exactly what yet, stay tuned ;)</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"September 01, 2017","path":"/blog/typescript-at-1030-part-1","title":"TypeScript at 10:30pm (Part 1)"}}},"pageContext":{}}}
